# danielcon.nl

Very punny. Its a play on my name Daniel Connell. After browsing all the possible TLDs -- `.nl` (Netherlands) allowed my name to be phonetically read.

## What is it?
I dont claim to be a front-end guy, but wanted a website to show interested parties my professional and music projects. I used flask with gunicorn as the web framework. I then _tried_ to make it look pretty with Bootstrap.
